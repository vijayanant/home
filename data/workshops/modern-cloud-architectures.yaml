title: "Modern Cloud Architectures: A Hands-On Guide"
description: "A practical workshop for software engineers and architects who want to learn how to design and build scalable, resilient, and cost-effective cloud-native applications."
overview: "The cloud has changed the way we build and deploy software. But with so many different services and architectural patterns to choose from, it can be hard to know where to start. This workshop is designed to cut through the noise and give you a practical, hands-on guide to designing and building modern cloud architectures. We'll cover the most important cloud services and architectural patterns, and you'll learn how to apply them in practice. You'll leave with the skills and confidence you need to build cloud-native applications that are scalable, resilient, and cost-effective."
key_takeaways:
  - "Understand the key principles of cloud-native architecture."
  - "Learn how to choose the right cloud services for your needs."
  - "Discover how to design and build scalable, resilient, and cost-effective cloud-native applications."
  - "Learn how to use containers and serverless technologies to build and deploy your applications."
  - "Develop a framework for making sound architectural decisions in the cloud."
